Applying incremental learning on 3D knee surfaces and reconstruction in C++ with VTK and ITK

itkIncrementalPCAModelEstimator include batch PCA and incremental PCA.
Implemented with ITK and VTK
Incremental PCA is conducted in a subspace level.

itkIncrementalPCAModelEstimatorVisual is the test file.
Model is reconstruction using VTK.

Incremental PCA algorithm is proposed by Skoƒçaj, D. and Leonardis, A in "Incremental and robust learning of subspace representations" 2008.
